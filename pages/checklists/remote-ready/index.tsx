    body: "This might sound daunting for anyone to get into but it truly makes all the difference. It does not matter how small of a contribution you are making, correct some docs, fix grammar problems. You can make repositories where you collect resources (like this one), learnings, developer logs, etc. These things are the fundamentals that you can build upon right when you start.",

You help others struggling with the same thing, you help yourself understand it better, and you take steps towards building your developer brand. A potential hiring party can go in and see your progress and they can see how you communicate ideas or code to others, further they can see a glimpse of who you are and build a perception of you as a person.",

    title: "Comfortable to Share screen",
    body: "As a remote developer, you'll be sharing your screen a lot. Our computers are very private, and normally no one sees the things you keep there. Keep an SFW version of it, in case you need to share it unexpectedly.",
  },
  {
    title: "Clear communication",
    body: "The ability to explain code clearly and concisely and talk about complex topics. Code is sometimes difficult to explain because we are not used to talking while we code and our mind-maps of how things fit together will be unique to you. However, no one will hire you if you can not explain what you are doing.",

    body: "If you have constant background noise, like motorcycles, trucks, vacuum cleaners, and screaming, (you get the point), You will not be liked in your everyday meetings. Dare I say low-key hated? So, find a quiet spot to work.",
  },
  {
    title: "Voice Quality",
    body: "This ties into the above row, but if your microphone is bad, buy a new one. Record yourself, listen to it and you'll understand what the other side is hearing.",
  },
  {
    title: "Energy",
    body: "You want to send a lot of positive energy to the person you are talking to. You have to be interested in what you do and like to talk about things related to the field. Don't be a bigot, asshole, racist, or show other negative characteristics. At least pretend...",

It shows that you know what you don't know, and explain that you are willing to learn that asap if that's a required skill. Maybe fire up a new repo and do something with it, and send it soon after the meeting ended. It shows you are a self-starter and can learn new things when required.",
