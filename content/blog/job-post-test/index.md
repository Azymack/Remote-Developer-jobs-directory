This is my first job post test on the site! How exciting!

I'm sure we will get a lot of interesting opportunities up on the site in the future..

for an apply Link one can write like this (assuming you are looking at this in the .md file in your editor)
[APPLY NOW!](http://www.google.com).

Looks Like it's working! Now we only need to spread the word.
